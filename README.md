# Anki Prompt Variator

Anki Prompt Variator rephrases the front of your cards during review, reducing pattern matching and encouraging real recall.

Long-term Anki users often recognise answers after reading just a few words of a question, a phenomenon called cue-based recall or [pattern matching](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zSiuztCZ594AZuCweRghcXT). While using [different note types](https://expertium.github.io/Avoid_Pattern_Matching.html) can help, adding variations manually becomes tiring and time-expensive. The Prompt Variator addresses this by automatically varying prompts, keeping reviews challenging and memory stronger.
